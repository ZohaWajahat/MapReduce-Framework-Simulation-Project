Bicycles, eco-friendly and efficient, are used for commuting and recreation. Motorcycles, sleek and fast, appeal to those seeking an adrenaline rush. Trains, a symbol of industrial progress, connect cities and countries. Airplanes, soaring through the skies, make global travel possible in a matter of hours. Boats, gliding across rivers and lakes, are ideal for fishing and leisurely cruises. Ships, massive and robust, traverse oceans carrying passengers and cargo. Buses, reliable and affordable, serve as public transport in urban areas. Submarines, hidden beneath the waves, perform critical military and research operations.
